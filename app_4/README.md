In the last video I learnt:
### How to containerize a Python web application using Docker. 
It covers setting up a Flask app, configuring Nginx as a reverse proxy, and using uWSGI for serving Python applications. The video explains how to create a Dockerfile, set up Docker Compose, and link the components to run your Flask app inside Docker containers. This process allows for efficient deployment and scaling of your web apps in a production environment.
